;;; Commentary:

;; This is an input method for Old Norse text in Emacs, meant to work
;; with either standard US or standard Scandinavian keyboard layouts.
;; Like TeX input, characters are entered using \, but many use
;; shorter abbreviations than TeX.
;;
;; How to type letters:
;;  - The acute accent is created with \'a, \'y, etc
;;  - Þ, þ, Ð and ð are written \Th, \th, \Dh, \dh
;;  - E and o caudata are written \,e and \,o
;;  - Æ, æ, Œ, œ are written \Ae, \ae, \Oe, and \oe
;;  - Capital and lowercase o diaresis are written \"O and \"o
;;  - Slashed o is written \/o (or \'/o or \'ø with acute accent)
;; Some additional, LaTeX-inspired abbreviations are also available.
