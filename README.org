* Old Norse input for Emacs

This is an input method for Old Norse text in Emacs, meant to work
with either standard US or standard Scandinavian keyboard layouts.
Like TeX input, characters are entered using \, but many use
shorter abbreviations than TeX.

How to type letters:
 - The acute accent is created with =\'a=, =\'y=, etc
 - Þ, þ, Ð and ð are written =\Th=, =\th=, =\Dh=, =\dh=
 - E and o caudata are written =\,e= and =\,o=
 - Æ, æ, Œ, œ are written =\Ae=, =\ae=, =\Oe=, and =\oe=
 - Capital and lowercase o diaresis are written =\"O= and =\"o=
 - Slashed o is written =\/o= (or =\'/o= or =\'ø= with acute accent)

Some additional, LaTeX-inspired abbreviations are also available.

* How to Use

First, load the file into Emacs. Then,
  =M-x set-input-method RET old-norse RET=
will enable the input method. To turn it off again, use
  =M-x toggle-input-method RET=.
